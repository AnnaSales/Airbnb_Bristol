# Airbnb_Bristol

## Project description

This repo contains analysis of the open source Airbnb rental data for the city of Bristol, UK. It was prepared as a submission for the Data Scientist course run by Udacity, but also allowed me to test run my skills in Python, including Pandas and Scikit-learn.

I have focused mainly on data relating to neighbourhoods in Bristol, but have also included a little price prediction which takes account of other factors. Please see my blog post at XXXXX for the results of my analysis.

## Installation 

This project was created using a Jupyter notebook (Python 3). I have used the following libraries:

* Numpy and Pandas for wrangling dataframes and arrays 
* Matpotlib for visualisations
* Scipy and Statsmodels for statistical analysis
* Scikit-learn for machine learning

The source data ('listings.csv') is freely available from the link below, under the 'Bristol UK' heading
